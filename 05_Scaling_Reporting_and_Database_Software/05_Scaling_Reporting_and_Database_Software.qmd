# Databases
## DBMS: servers and clients

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.incremental}
- most DBMS are set up in client-server architecture:
  + server: can be a computer somewhere or a process on your own computer that fullfills requests
  + DBMS server: contains the database and database management system
  + client: interacts with server (sends requests, receives responses)
  + DBMS client: can upload and retrieve data from server or send processing instructions
- Why though:
  + server can run on more powerful hardware somewhere else
  + requests from multiple users don't interfere with each other
  + access control per user to support different roles

## RDBMS software

- many popular choices alternatives:
  + Oracle Database
  + MySQL
  + Microsoft SQL Server
  + IBM Db2
  + Microsoft Access
  + SQLite (free software)
  + MariaDB (free software)
- all use slightly different dialects of `SQL`, but the core functionality is the same
- We will use `PostgreSQL`: free and open source, well-known, and many other programming languages and tools can interface to it


# Working with PostgreSQL
## Installation

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
We are using Docker to spin up a local server that has PostgreSQL already installed.

You have to type this into your **Terminal**(!):

```sh
docker-compose -f 05_Scaling_Reporting_and_Database_Software/data/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

This is running the compose file below:

```yml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres
    container_name: postgres_db
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: pgpasswd
      POSTGRES_DB: dbintro
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  pgdata:
```

:::

::: {.column width="30%" }
![](media/terminal.png)
:::
::::

## Connecting from `R`

```{r}
library(DBI)
library(RPostgres)
db <- dbConnect(
  Postgres(),
  dbname = "dbintro",
  host = "localhost",  # Make sure to specify the host
  port = 5432L,
  user = "postgres",
  password = "pgpasswd"
)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
# To make sure this produces the same results every time, I remove all users and tables from the database
tables <- dbListTables(db)
for (t in tables) {
  dbExecute(db, paste("DROP TABLE", t))
}
user <- dbGetQuery(db, "SELECT usename FROM pg_user") |> 
  pull(usename) |> 
  setdiff("postgres")
for (u in user) {
  dbExecute(db, paste("DROP USER", u))
}
```

Let's fill this database with the `nycflights13` flights data:

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
dbWriteTable(db, "airports", airports, overwrite = TRUE)
dbWriteTable(db, "flights", flights, overwrite = TRUE)
dbWriteTable(db, "weather", weather, overwrite = TRUE)
dbWriteTable(db, "planes", planes, overwrite = TRUE)
dbWriteTable(db, "airlines", airlines, overwrite = TRUE)
```

## Connecting from the terminal

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
```sh
docker exec -it -u postgres postgres_db psql -d dbintro
```

Inside the Docker container (that is the name of a server running via docker), you can list tables with:

```SQL
\dt
```

You can run `SQL` operations in here without `R`:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM airports;
#                     ^
```

Note that commands are only executed when `SQL` encounters a `;`!

- Exit a long print with `q`

## Working with `PostgreSQL`: pretty similar to SQLite...

But not the same...

```{r}
#| echo: false
# just to make sure the tables do not exist already
try(dbExecute(db, "DROP TABLE df1"))
try(dbExecute(db, "DROP TABLE df2"))
```


```{r}
dbExecute(db,
          "CREATE TABLE df1 (
              id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
              capital_letters VARCHAR(1) CHECK (capital_letters ~ '^[A-Z]$'), 
              my_date DATE CHECK (my_date > '2000-01-01')
          )")
```

## Working with `PostgreSQL` and `dbplyr`: the same as `SQLite`

I copied this from the last session, and it works just as well:

```{r}
#| output-location: column
tbl(db, "flights") |> 
  inner_join(tbl(db, "planes"), by = "tailnum", suffix = c("", "_plane")) |> 
  mutate(plane_age = year - year_plane) |> 
  select(arr_delay, plane_age) |> 
  filter(!is.na(arr_delay),
         !is.na(plane_age)) |> 
  collect() |> 
  group_by(plane_age) |> 
  summarise(avg_delay = mean(arr_delay)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = plane_age, y = avg_delay)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x)
```


## User-based authentication

Imagine this:

- you have a team of researchers
- some are responsible for data gathering (annotation, webscraping, conducting survey waves, etc.)
- some are responsible for data analysis
- you are responsible for data management and public reporting
- You want to make sure that:
  - researchers in team gathering do not overwrite each others changes
  - team analysis always has the newest data
  - the summary data on the website is online as soon as possible
- with `PostgreSQL` you can make sure the two groups don disrupt each other and the most recent results are pull from the database automatically

## User-based authentication: users

We create three new users:

- one for the one researchers in the gatherer group
- one for the one analyser in the analysis group
- one called "reader" which represents the general public


```{r}
dbExecute(db, "CREATE USER gatherer WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'supersecret'")
dbExecute(db, "CREATE USER analyser WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'supersecret'")
dbExecute(db, "CREATE USER reader WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'supersecret'")
```

We can look at users:

```{r}
dbGetQuery(db, "SELECT usename FROM pg_user")
```

## User-based authentication: users

Let's log in as analyser:

```{r}
db_analyser <- dbConnect(
  Postgres(),
  dbname = "dbintro",
  host = "localhost",  # Make sure to specify the host
  port = 5432L,
  user = "analyser",
  password = "supersecret"
)
```


## User-based authentication: roles

So far, neither of the new users can do anything:

```{r}
#| error: true
tbl(db_analyser, "flights")
```

They have to be assigned roles first

## User-based authentication: roles

We first give the "gatherer" user permission to update a table:

```{r}
dbExecute(db, "GRANT UPDATE,INSERT ON flights TO gatherer")
```

Since we do not fully trust the analyser, we give him read-only access to flights, but access to everything in `df1`, which we pretend that the results of the analysis are stored in:

```{r}
dbExecute(db, "GRANT SELECT ON flights TO analyser")
dbExecute(db, "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON df1 TO analyser")
```

Finally, the public gets selected access to only some columns in the results table:

```{r}
dbExecute(db, "GRANT SELECT (capital_letters) ON df1 TO reader")
```

## User-based authentication: roles (analyser)

Still logged in as the analyser, let's try to access the data again:

```{r}
tbl(db_analyser, "flights")
```

But we still can't make changes:

```{r}
#| error: true
dbExecute(db_analyser,
          "INSERT INTO flights (year)
            VALUES (2013)")
```

## User-based authentication: roles (gatherer)

Logging in as the gatherer, we can add new cases:

```{r}
db_gatherer <- dbConnect(
  Postgres(),
  dbname = "dbintro",
  host = "localhost",  # Make sure to specify the host
  port = 5432L,
  user = "gatherer",
  password = "supersecret"
)
dbExecute(db_gatherer,
          "INSERT INTO flights (year)
            VALUES (2013)")
```

## User-based authentication: roles (reader)

Logging in as the reader, we can can't change anything, but can only read specific columns:

```{r}
db_reader <- dbConnect(
  Postgres(),
  dbname = "dbintro",
  host = "localhost",  # Make sure to specify the host
  port = 5432L,
  user = "reader",
  password = "supersecret"
)
```

```{r}
#| error: true
dbGetQuery(db_reader, "SELECT * FROM df1")
```

```{r}
dbGetQuery(db_reader, "SELECT capital_letters FROM df1")
```

Now we could give out this user to the public without the need to worry that they change or read anything they are not supposed to.


## Exercises 1

Using the `PostgreSQL` database or the `SQLite` database from session 4:

1. Right join `results_state` and `facts` using `dbplyr` instead of `dbGetQuery`
2. Recreate the table `results_state_time` by querying and joining from db (using `dbplyr` instead of `dbGetQuery`).
3. Recreate `results_state_facts` using `dbplyr`. Don't forget to add `total_votes` and `pct_votes`
4. Extract the SQL query from your code in 3. and run it with `dbGetQuery`

## Installation

Same as with `PostgreSQL`, we can use Docker.

1. Download the compose file:

```{r}
curl::curl_download(
  url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ccs-amsterdam/amcat4docker/main/docker-compose.yml", 
  destfile = "data/docker-compose-amcat.yml"
)
```

2. Spin it up via the Terminal

```sh
docker-compose -f 05_Scaling_Reporting_and_Database_Software/data/docker-compose-amcat.yml up -d
```

## Connecting from the terminal

Creating a test index:

```sh
docker exec -it amcat4 amcat4 create-test-index
```

Configure the AmCAT server:

```sh
docker exec -it amcat4 amcat4 config
```


## Connecting from `R`

We need to log in, which you can do without a user by default:

```{r}
# remotes::install_github("ccs-amsterdam/amcat4r")
library(amcat4r)
amcat_login("http://localhost/amcat")
```

We can have a look at the example corpus with:

```{r}
query_documents(index = "state_of_the_union")
```


## Dataset

Load data from @ParlSpeech into AmCAT:

```{r}
#| eval: false
corp_hoc_df <- readRDS("../03_Working_with_Files/data/Corp_HouseOfCommons_V2.rds") |> 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date)) |> 
  rename(title = agenda) |> 
  filter(!is.na(date)) |> 
  replace_na(list(title = "", text = "")) |> 
  select(-party.facts.id)

# define types of fields
fields = list(
  date = "date",
  text = "text",
  title = "text",        
  speechnumber = "integer",   
  speaker = "keyword",       
  party = "keyword",
  chair = "boolean",      
  terms = "integer",          
  parliament = "keyword", 
  iso3country = "keyword"
)
# create the index
create_index(index = "houseofcommons", 
             name = "House Of Commons", 
             description = "HouseOfCommons", 
             create_fields = fields)

# upload the data
upload_documents("houseofcommons", documents = corp_hoc_df, chunk_size = 1000, verbose = TRUE)
```

## AmCAT GUI

- Access at: <http://localhost/>
- Search and explore data
- Queries are made in Elasticsearch's “mini-language” for query strings (<https://bit.ly/elastic_queries>)
- Let's see some examples!

# Scaling your research
## Benchmarking

- when your data grows, it becomes important that your code is fast, since it is applied to many cases
- benchmarking helps you identify bottlenecks
- it can make the difference between minutes and days whether your code is optimised for speed

## Benchmarking with `bench`

Basic syntax:

1. define functions that wrap your code

```{r}
library(bench)
fun1 <- function() {
  1 + 1
}
fun2 <- function() {
  a <- 1
  b <- 1
  sum(c(a, b))
}
```

2. run `mark`

```{r}
res <- mark(simple = fun1, complex = fun1)
```

3. check summary

```{r}
summary(res)
summary(res, relative = TRUE)
```


## Benchmarking: in memory vs in database

1. define functions that wrap your code

```{r}
in_memory <- function() {
  nycflights13::flights |> 
    inner_join(nycflights13::weather, by = c("time_hour", "origin")) |> 
    filter(time_hour < "2013-03-01")
}

in_db <- function() {
  tbl(db, "flights") |> 
    inner_join(tbl(db, "weather"), by = c("time_hour", "origin")) |> 
    filter(time_hour < "2013-03-01") |> 
    collect()
}
```

2. run `mark`

```{r}
res <- mark(in_memory = in_memory, in_db = in_db, check = FALSE, iterations = 15)
```

3. check summary

```{r}
summary(res)
summary(res, relative = TRUE)
```

## Fix bottlenecks

Without an index, the search in the database takes longer.
You can create it automatically with `opy_to()` (see [this](https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/dbplyr.html?q=nyc#connecting-to-the-database))

```{r}
dbExecute(db, "CREATE INDEX ON flights (time_hour)")
dbExecute(db, "CREATE INDEX ON weather (time_hour)")
```

1. define functions that wrap your code

```{r}
in_memory <- function() {
  nycflights13::flights |> 
    inner_join(nycflights13::weather, by = c("time_hour", "origin")) |> 
    filter(time_hour < "2013-03-01")
}

in_db <- function() {
  tbl(db, "flights") |> 
    inner_join(tbl(db, "weather"), by = c("time_hour", "origin")) |> 
    filter(time_hour < "2013-03-01") |> 
    collect()
}
```

2. run `mark`

```{r}
res <- mark(in_memory = in_memory, in_db = in_db, check = FALSE, iterations = 15)
```

3. check summary

```{r}
summary(res)
summary(res, relative = TRUE)
```

# Data Management: Summary
## What for?

- enables new research questions by being able to combine and clean new data
- let's you sleep easy at night
- makes your work transparent to others and yourself
- thinking about reproducibility from the start

## When to use files vs. databases

- often not clear from the start
- working with files is easier as a solo researchers (who keeps a clean project directory)
- when data changes regularly it makes sense to not add to the same file again and again
- when several researchers collaborate, a database solves many issues
- when you have text data, vectors, or complex elements, NoSQL databases like AmCAT or MongoDB can make sense

# When done, `dbDisconnect`

Whenever you are done working with a database, you should disconnect from it: 

```{r}
dbDisconnect(db)
dbDisconnect(db_analyser)
dbDisconnect(db_gatherer)
dbDisconnect(db_reader)
```

- This closes the connection, discards all pending work, and frees resources


# Wrap Up

Save some information about the session for reproducibility.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show Session Info"
sessionInfo()
```
