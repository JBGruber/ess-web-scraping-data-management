## Excercises 1

1. Download the file from this address into the "data" folder and name it "internet_usage.xlsx" using R: <https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/IT.NET.USER.ZS?downloadformat=excel>
2. Reproduce this plot (hint: you can get grey out cases with `gghighlight`):

3. I created a terrible CSV file. Try to read it in anyway: "data/csv-bad-example.csv"
4. Even when you manage to read in the file, the table still has issue. Explain what they are and how to correct them (hint: look at the data types of the columns)

## Exercises 3

1. When might it make sense to treat a folder full of files as a database?
2. When could it make sense to save data in an arrow database full of csv files?
3. `arrow` also supports a file format called Parquet. Using it instead of CSV files increases speed and reduces file sizes, while it is also widely used by other languages and programs. Create a new folder where you store the Houses of Commons data in one file per speaker (hint read `?arrow::write_parquet` first).
4. Connect to the "database" of Parquet files and make a plot showing how many entries there are over the years per party.
